# containerCP
A rewrite of natCP, but with more features and eventual user API. Currently, it is planned for the panel to make use of PHP/Laravel, HTML/CSS/JS and Vue, with slave tools written in C and Bash.

## Roadmap

### Slave 
- Node communications with master (in progress)
- Control wrapper (in progress)
- Serial console/emergency shell access
- Container cloning (not confirmed yet)

### Master
- User API
- Template system
- Possible support system
- IP management (v4 support first, then v6 support)
- User management (mostly done)
- Permissions (in progress)

I expect that an alpha release will be ready within a few months.
